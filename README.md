### Conclusion
Predicting houses based on year and implementing hyperparameter tuning of several model algorithms such as RandomForestRegressor, Lasso, and LinearRegression which serves to get accurate results. The final results obtained by the Linear Regression and Deep Learning methods get a very small loss value.
